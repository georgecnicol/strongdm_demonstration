The docker directory has the code for a basic flask app. The flask app is just something to
put on a fargate cluster in AWS for fun.

The terraform directory uses the docker image stored in ECR to build the fargate app
and of course the rest of the infrastructure - vpc, sdm gateway, compute resurce,
security groups and so on.

This was a fun side project to put together some infrastructure in AWS using terrafrom
and hook it up to StrongDM. Obviously there are some additional StrongDM configuration
requirements in the app like setting up resources and managing users and so on.
